# pjskareaconvo-maker

OK WE GOT IT WORKING YAY!!! this was supposed to be a silly thing to learn python and streamlit but it ended up taking me all summer. blegh

anyway! this is something to make putting together my pjsk area convo code a bit easier! you make speakers, create area conversations, add dialogue to the area conversations, and at the end you can export it as an HTML file to add to your literatures ^^

- [applet here](https://pjsk-area-convo-maker.streamlit.app/)
- toyhou.se listing (applet)
- [toyhou.se listing (code)](https://toyhou.se/26394659.pjsk-area-conversation-f2u)

### things to note:
- the HTML itself is still mobile friendly, bootstrap colors with some custom colors
- i dont know why the buttons for rearranging the area convos are weird. sorrrryyyyyy
- i suggest putting the exported HTML into circlejourney and formatting it bc its really messy xP

### credits:
- sekai.best for assets, Elithian for HTML resources, pjsk is still colopale's
- thank u streamlit Youre awesome
